## About the creative process
```
At the beginning of this year (2023), I went through some difficult moments, in which my psychological was shaken. One of the things that most made me to forgot the problems and made me fell good was watching and playing something related to Harry Potter's saga. And being a big fan, I had the idea to make a game that entered on this magical world. 
Besides that, I'm an engineering student and I like math a lot, and one thing that helped me to desenvolve a mathematical logical reasoning, in addition to agility in accounts, was practice on apps that involved this type of challenge.
So, I joined both of this ideas and develop the "Rescue", in which I hope that the users can have fun and learn a little bit while playing.
